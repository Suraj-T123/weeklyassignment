            <p>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually <br>refers to the experience aspects of website development rather than software <br>development. Web design used to be focused on desigining websites for desktop <br>browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has <br>become ever-increasingly important.</p>
